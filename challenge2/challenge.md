## Round 2: Seceratary For A Day

In this round, your team will add new commands to your existing bot to support new functionality.

Keep in mind:
- When implementing a part, **you must retain the behaviour of all previous parts**. We need to be able to test your bot against all parts that you solve.
- Your bot will be expected to reply with the computed answer to specific problems when instructed using the following format `@botName 2.[part]` e.g for the first question `@botName 2.1` and second question `@botName 2.2` which will be handled by an existing template function where you will implement the required functionality
- You may complete these challenges in any order, there is no requirement to start complete specific parts before moving on.
- **Your bot will also be evaluated using input data that is not provided here**. Therefore it must actually solve the task that that's given
